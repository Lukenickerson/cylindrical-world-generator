Cylindrical World Generator
===========================

A world generator/simulation for [Procedural Game Jam 2014](http://itch.io/jam/procjam).
The world appears two-dimensional, but there is a height value for each x/y coordinate.
The map is *cyclindrical* because it wraps in the x-axis but not in the y-axis.

The simulation uses a number of procedures:
* Procedural "randomness" based on sine curve
* Plate tectonics using vornoi cells
* Constant water volume and sea-level adjustments
* Height Smoothing
* Raindrop Erosion
* Coastal erosion
* Micro-organism arrival via comet and population growth
* Grass evolution and growth
